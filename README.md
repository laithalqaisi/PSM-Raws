# PSM-Raws
***This is a copy of an old repo of mine.***

A simple winforms application that reorders the downloaded pages that's shuffled from the pocket shounen magazine and saves them as png files.

Made for a scan group(at the time) to be able to use HQ raws for manga series and such.

------------------------------

Only works on windows because it's based on winforms but the logic itself is trivial to convert.

How to use:

1) Open the chapter you want in https://pocket.shonenmagazine.com/ to download and press Ctrl+Shift+I to open the inspect tools.

2) Open up the "Application" tab then go to frames > top > Images, choose the image you want, then right click it and "save image as".

3) Download the winform app and run it.

4) Put all the downloaded files in a folder.

5) Copy the folder path that have all the downloaded files and put it in the first box.

6) Copy the folder path that you want to save the reordered images to and put it in the second box. 

7) Click the "Rename and convert to png" button.

8) Click the "Reorder and save" button.

9) Enjoy.

Note: if the 2 boxes are not filled with a correct path, the application will give out an error.
